# 💰 Financial Management System – backend

This project is the backend component of a university project. During the project I focused on building a secure and user-friendly **financial management system**. It streamlines access to Swedbank banking data and enables efficient account and transaction analysis using the **Swedbank Open Banking API**.

## 🔍 Overview

The backend serves as the middleware between the client (Vue 3 frontend) and the Swedbank API. It handles:

- OAuth 2.0-based authentication and token management
- Consent and permission management
- Data retrieval for accounts, balances, and transactions
- Secure API request routing and standardization
